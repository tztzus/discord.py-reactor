# discord.py-reactor


This script is a Discord selfbot (not a bot token) that reacts to messages in a specific channel (or DM/GC) with a series of emojis:

Default Reactions: 🍍, 🥧, 🏳️‍⚧️, 🏳️‍🌈
Custom Reactions: Spells out "FEMBOY" using letter emojis (🇫🇪🇲🇧🇴🇾).
It logs in with your Discord account and shows a startup message with credits to @zus.s on Discord. The channel to monitor is specified by replacing TARGET_CHANNEL_ID with a valid ID.

⚠️ Note: Selfbots violate Discord's Terms of Service, so use responsibly and with caution!
